# CDP Spark Workload Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)


## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a Spark Workload on a Cloudera Data Platform (CDP).

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).


### What's a Workload?

Workload refers to any data processing step (ETL, job, transformation etc.) that is applied to data in a Data Product. Workloads can pull data from sources external to the Data Mesh or from an Output Port of a different Data Product or from Storage Areas inside the same Data Product, and persist it for further processing or serving.


### Cloudera Data Platform
Cloudera Data Platform is a hybrid data platform designed for freedom to choose any cloud, any analytics, any data.

CDP delivers faster and easier data management and data analytics for data anywhere, with optimal performance, scalability, and security.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html).

### Apache Spark™
Apache Spark™ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://spark.apache.org/).

## Usage

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).


### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the Data Product, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for [CDP Spark Workload](./policies/cdp.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview).
